Magic Playlist is an intelligent algorithm developed under Spotify's API that enables users to create a playlist based on a song.

The algorithm detects the main artists and creates a playlist based on their high rated tracks. You can preview each song, remove it and add security attributions such as public or private. Give it a name, save it into your Spotify's account and enjoy!
